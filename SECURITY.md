# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Prototype phase (0.x). Breaking changes likely until 1.0.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please DO NOT open public issues for security problems.

Instead use one of:
1. GitHub: Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability")
2. Private email: <ADD_CONTACT_EMAIL>

Provide:
- Affected component / path
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if any)

We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours.

## Handling Process
1. Triage & reproduce
2. Assign CVSS (internal)

4. Release fix & disclose

## Best Practices (Planned Hardening)
- Strict Content Security Policy
- Perâ€‘user API tokens & rotation
- Enhanced audit logging
- Sandboxed command execution isolation
- Schema validation for all inputs
